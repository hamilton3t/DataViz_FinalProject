This repository contains material for my final project in DATA/STAT 334 in the Spring 2024 semester. I chose to explore Tour de France data and posed several questions of interest. This included the average age of Tour de France winners, comparing a winner's age to their team's average age, and looking into the top-performing countries, teams, and individual riders. Through this, I built a shiny app containing various tabs to focus on the specific questions that I posed. I also made the visualizations interactive with input selections so that myself and other users can explore areas of interest.
